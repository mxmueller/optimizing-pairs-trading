This research project explores **Machine Learning Optimizations for Pair Selection in Pairs Trading**, investigating whether modern ML approaches can outperform traditional statistical methods in identifying profitable trading pairs. The study compares machine learning techniques (Gradient Boost Regressor and Affinity Propagation) against conventional cointegration-based methods, testing their performance on major European and US indices including the N₁₀₀ and F₁₀₀.

This work is conducted as a **two-semester student research project** at the [DHBW Heidenheim](https://www.heidenheim.dhbw.de/en/home), focusing on the intersection of quantitative finance and machine learning applications in algorithmic trading.
